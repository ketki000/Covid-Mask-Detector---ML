# Covid-Mask-Detector---ML

I have created a mask detector using SVC(Support Vector Classifier)

# Tools and Libraries used-

1. Bing Image downloader - for web scraping data
2. Numpy - working with arrays
4. Pandas - Data manipulation
5. Sklearn - model selection and analysing
6. Skimage - image preprocessing - Multi-dimensional NumPy arrays
7.Support Vector Machine - SVC


#End Result 

Classifies any input image into 2 categories - mask or without mask
